Making a match schedule:
    for a tournament:
        make sure that it is open, complete, or closed for judging (each should have a special display)
        then check for those tournaments if our team is involved within those tournaments 
        then check if those tournaments are ongoing or happening currently
    now list out each event, for every event:
        there should be a match:
            check the number of teams and divide by the number of possible pairings in a bracket
            if our team isn't in the starting teams (we have a bye)
                list the advancer of the team that:
                    if they are a higher ranking, and we aren't, them
                    if we are both high rankings, don'take
                    if we have a higher ranking, and they don't, that's our next match
                continue to pair with the otehr teams that advance in our bracket
                    the number of bracket pairings will decrease
            if our team is in the starting teams
                we are against a team with a lower ranking if we have a higher tanking
                we are against a team with a hgiher ranking if we have a lower ranking
                anything else should be a random ranking for those that are in-between or lower
        for matches within a group:
            we should list every team particpating and our team
            im not sure if we progress or not but just do the above
    the end of the events should list these stats with points
a competition has a tournament. ^^^
