--> Have the homework for results page (will probably take 2-3 days to finish)
---> Can also work on simplifying code and finding repetiion (create methods)
I will work on:
1) Adding the email to the User account
--> Researching the static profile image
3) The formula for round robin points
4) Auto-complete tournament --> as soon as the user logs in, and the last match is judged, complete it
---> Profile forms if I finished the above
6) Automatically Advance multiple teams
7) Automatically advance (low values)
8) Score sorting --> began working on
(do a formula to subtract point differences between round_robin_points)
