here is where I will design the competition_map layout

what do you need:
- the area where the competition will be held
- generate a color-coded version of schedule
- put room numbers
- key 
- name of map 
- should be customizable for any school or area that it is linked to
- find a way to source the map out of schools, or someone should upload a copy
