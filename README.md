# CompServer
CompServer is a Django web app designed to aid in the setup, running, scoring and reporting of tournament-style competitions. The original target audience is the [RoboMed Tournament](https://www.mais-web.org/robotics-robomed-tournament) but should be general enough to be applicable to a wide variety of robotics competitions and even other competitions that have nothing to do with robotics.
