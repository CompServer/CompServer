Useful libraries

    Probably not worth hacking to handle 3 or more teams for a single match
    HTML / CSS it generates can be used as a model

Questions
Do we need to handle / show penalties?

Scenarios (in order of rank ABCD...)
max4adv1
    ACE
        AB
    BDF
    Instead of
    ACEF
        AB
    BD (this group has an unfair advantage)
max4adv2
    ACEG
        ACB
    BDF
    Or maybe rather
    ACEG
        ACBD
    BDF
    Both are valid: the organizer could want either (how to let them choose?)
Version 1
Only handle 1v1 single-elimination tournament
Create Schools and Teams through the Django admin interface
Setup a tournament:
    Enter number of teams (force it to be a power of two: no bye's)
    Add teams: the order you add them determines the seeding
    Generate matches
Run a tournament:
    Visually show the bracket (with jQuery Bracket-like visualization)
    Judge (only) clicking on a match -> score entering page (could be admin for the Match initially)
    Judge (only) enters who advanced for the Match
    Viewers refresh bracket (manually) to show who advanced
    
Version 2


Use HTMX to poll to refresh the bracket like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsGZ9361hlU


Common language
- Organization (vs School)
- Competition (RoboMed 2024) vs Tournament (Sumo SET)
- Event (Sumo)
- Match (one encounter 1v1 or 4v4)

Questions
- What do you hope to get from the project
    - why the current solution is bad / hard
        - making sure every team has the same # matches in prelim rounds, not in same place at the same time and not competing against the same team twice (across multiple events)
        - don't miss any matches (recording win / loss)
    - what are some cool things you think it could provide
        - unique ID for match to make the scorekeeper's job easier
- Are statuses currently sufficient?
- Penalties?
- Sensitivities of data (probably no student names but what about coaches)
- Ever any need to give variable points (not just win / loss)
- Specific time for matches?


Product Owner (jschwartz) Presentation Notes
- Preliminary rounds determine the seeding of the tournament
- Each event is worth the same # points (different points per match event)
- As much wait time between matches as possible (evenly spread out): avoid back to back matches
- 4 points for winning the SET 
- Each judge is dedicated to a specific arena / event 
- Speed race could be 1 v 1
- 20 sportsmanship points that get taken away (penalties)
